- 👋 Hi, I’m Zhardae
- 👀 I’m interested in securing an entry level Python development role/full-time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tkinter to apply the concepts I already am familiar with to web development. I am almost halfway into the 100 Days of Python challenges. I have basic knowledge from school and online courses, but I want to gain real world experience. I am also familiar with MySQL and managing databases.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner Python projects and advance with patience and practice.
